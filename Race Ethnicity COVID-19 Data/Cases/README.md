# COVID-19 Cases by Race/Ethnicity as of May 26, 2020

## Footnotes:
<ul>
  <li>The percentages in Arkansas, California, Idaho, Kentucky, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Washington were adjusted to include those with unknown race/ethnicity in the total.</li>
  <li>The data in Rhode Island, Vermont, and West Virginia are based only on cases and/or deaths where race and ethnicity information is known.</li>
  <li>Individuals may identify as more than one race or ethnicity so totals may not sum to 100%.</li>
</ul>


## Sources:

  <li>Distribution of Cases/Deaths by Race/Ethnicity based on KFF analysis of publicly available state websites.</li>

## Notes:
<ul>
  <li>Total cases and/or deaths in each state may not sum to 100% due to rounding or pending or missing information.</li>
  <li>In most states, percentages are based on a total of all confirmed cases and deaths, including those with unknown race/ethnicity.</li>
  <li>Shares of cases and deaths may not be directly comparable due to differences in unknown rates.</li>
  <li>Some states report data on cases and deaths for Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander individuals, but data are insufficient for comparisons to total population distribution.</li>
  <li>Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race. States vary in whether they include or exclude Hispanic individuals from race categories. States that include Hispanic individuals in race categories are indicated by a "Yes" in the "Race Categories Include Hispanic Individuals" column. In the other states, these groups only include non-Hispanic individuals.</li>
